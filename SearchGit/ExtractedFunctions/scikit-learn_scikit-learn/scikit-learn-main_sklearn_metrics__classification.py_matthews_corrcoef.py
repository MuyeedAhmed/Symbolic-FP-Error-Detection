def matthews_corrcoef(y_true, y_pred, *, sample_weight=None):
    """Compute the Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC).

    The Matthews correlation coefficient is used in machine learning as a
    measure of the quality of binary and multiclass classifications. It takes
    into account true and false positives and negatives and is generally
    regarded as a balanced measure which can be used even if the classes are of
    very different sizes. The MCC is in essence a correlation coefficient value
    between -1 and +1. A coefficient of +1 represents a perfect prediction, 0
    an average random prediction and -1 an inverse prediction.  The statistic
    is also known as the phi coefficient. [source: Wikipedia]

    Binary and multiclass labels are supported.  Only in the binary case does
    this relate to information about true and false positives and negatives.
    See references below.

    Parameters
    ----------
    y_true : array-like of shape (n_samples,)
        Ground truth (correct) target values.

    y_pred : array-like of shape (n_samples,)
        Estimated targets as returned by a classifier.

    sample_weight : array-like of shape (n_samples,), default=None
        Sample weights.

    Returns
    -------
    mcc : float
        The Matthews correlation coefficient (+1 represents a perfect
        prediction, 0 an average random prediction and -1 and inverse
        prediction).
