    Orthonormalize w wrt the first j rows of W.

    ----------
    w : ndarray of shape (n,)
        Array to be orthogonalized

    W : ndarray of shape (p, n)
        Null space definition

    j : int < p
        The no of (from the first) rows of Null space W wrt which w is
        orthogonalized.

    Assumes that W is orthogonal
