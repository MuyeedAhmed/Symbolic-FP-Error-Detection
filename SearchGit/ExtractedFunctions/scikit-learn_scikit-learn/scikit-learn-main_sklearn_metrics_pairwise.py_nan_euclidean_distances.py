def nan_euclidean_distances(
    X, Y=None, *, squared=False, missing_values=np.nan, copy=True
):
    """Calculate the euclidean distances in the presence of missing values.

    Compute the euclidean distance between each pair of samples in X and Y,
    where Y=X is assumed if Y=None. When calculating the distance between a
    pair of samples, this formulation ignores feature coordinates with a
    missing value in either sample and scales up the weight of the remaining
    coordinates:

    .. code-block:: text

        dist(x,y) = sqrt(weight * sq. distance from present coordinates)

    where:

    .. code-block:: text

        weight = Total # of coordinates / # of present coordinates

    For example, the distance between ``[3, na, na, 6]`` and ``[1, na, 4, 5]`` is:

    .. math::
        \\sqrt{\\frac{4}{2}((3-1)^2 + (6-5)^2)}

    If all the coordinates are missing or if there are no common present
    coordinates then NaN is returned for that pair.

    Parameters
    ----------
    X : array-like of shape (n_samples_X, n_features)
        An array where each row is a sample and each column is a feature.

    Y : array-like of shape (n_samples_Y, n_features), default=None
        An array where each row is a sample and each column is a feature.
        If `None`, method uses `Y=X`.

    squared : bool, default=False
        Return squared Euclidean distances.

    missing_values : np.nan, float or int, default=np.nan
        Representation of missing value.

    copy : bool, default=True
        Make and use a deep copy of X and Y (if Y exists).

    Returns
    -------
    distances : ndarray of shape (n_samples_X, n_samples_Y)
        Returns the distances between the row vectors of `X`
        and the row vectors of `Y`.
