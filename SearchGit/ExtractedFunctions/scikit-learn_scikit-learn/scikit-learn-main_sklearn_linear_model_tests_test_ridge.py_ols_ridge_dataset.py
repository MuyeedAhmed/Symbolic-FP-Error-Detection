def ols_ridge_dataset(global_random_seed, request):
    """Dataset with OLS and Ridge solutions, well conditioned X.

    The construction is based on the SVD decomposition of X = U S V'.

    Parameters
    ----------
    type : {"long", "wide"}
        If "long", then n_samples > n_features.
        If "wide", then n_features > n_samples.

    For "wide", we return the minimum norm solution w = X' (XX')^-1 y:

        min ||w||_2 subject to X w = y

    Returns
    -------
    X : ndarray
        Last column of 1, i.e. intercept.
    y : ndarray
    coef_ols : ndarray of shape
        Minimum norm OLS solutions, i.e. min ||X w - y||_2_2 (with minimum ||w||_2 in
        case of ambiguity)
        Last coefficient is intercept.
    coef_ridge : ndarray of shape (5,)
        Ridge solution with alpha=1, i.e. min ||X w - y||_2_2 + ||w||_2^2.
        Last coefficient is intercept.
